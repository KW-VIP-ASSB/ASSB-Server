# Project Structure Guide

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Airflow Directory**: Responsible for extracting data using Airflow and storing it in a PostgreSQL database.
   - Contains the source code for Airflow DAGs and related components in the `src/` directory.
   - Database-related configurations or scripts are likely in the `db/` directory.
   - Environment configurations for Airflow might be in the `airenv/` directory.
   - Docker setup files: [docker-compose.yaml](mdc:service/airflow/docker-compose.yaml) and [Dockerfile](mdc:service/airflow/Dockerfile).

2. **Backend Directory**: Implemented using FastAPI to open the migrated service database and respond to user queries.
   - FastAPI service code is located in the `service/` directory.
   - Environment configurations for FastAPI might be in the `fastenv/` directory.

The database schema is defined in the `service/airflow/src/dags/core/entity` directory, with various classes representing different tables such as `Style`, `StyleVariant`, `StyleImage`, etc.
